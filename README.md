When pressing space at the bottom of a page, this add-on will attempt to detect the next page and, if successful, go to it.

Due to how complicated it can be to detect the link to the next page for certain websites, this add-on is only tested on websites I personally go to. Additionally, it is unlikely to be distributed through [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/).
